# LinkUp

## Project Overview

#### **What This Project Does**  
LinkUp is a group chat application designed to seamlessly integrate scheduling and multilingual communication. It allows users to create a shared group calendar where individual schedules are combined. The app uses this data to generate a "time to LinkUp" that suits everyone's availability. Additionally, LinkUp enables users to participate in conversations in their preferred language, translating messages in real-time so each user reads messages in their own chosen language.

#### **Why the Project Was Made**  
Inspired by our project team, in which we speak 7 different languages, LinkUp was created to address the challenges of coordinating group activities and overcoming language barriers in global communities. Many people struggle with finding mutual availability in group settings, and multilingual communication can create friction in diverse teams or friendships. LinkUp was designed to bridge these gaps by combining calendar synchronization and instant language translation into one unified platform.

#### **What Problem This Project Solves**  
LinkUp solves two major issues:
1. **Group Scheduling Conflicts:** By centralizing schedules and generating recommended meeting times, LinkUp simplifies the often-tedious process of finding a time that works for everyone.
2. **Language Barriers in Communication:** With its real-time translation feature, LinkUp ensures that users can communicate freely in their native language, fostering better understanding and inclusivity.

#### **Is This Useful for Users?**  
If you are part of a global or multilingual group looking for a more efficient way to communicate and coordinate events, LinkUp is an great tool! It combines practical scheduling with enhanced communication, making it particularly useful for friend groups, remote teams, and international communities.

### Prerequisites

Ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 17 or higher
- **Apache Maven:** Version 3.6.0 or higher
- **MongoDB:** Ensure you have access to a MongoDB instance

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and execute:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CulmoneY/LinkUp.git
   ```

   This command clones the LinkUp repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd LinkUp
   ```

3. **Configure Application Properties**

   The application requires specific configurations:

   - Locate the `src/config.properties` file.
   - Open it in a text editor.
   - Update the following placeholders with your actual credentials:

     ```
     mongodb.connectionString=mongodb+srv://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@linkup.szhpc.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=LinkUp
     deepl.apiKey=your_deepl_api_key
     ```

   **Note:** To prevent accidental exposure of your credentials, run:

   ```bash
   git update-index --assume-unchanged src/config.properties
   ```

   This command ensures changes to `config.properties` are not tracked by Git.

4. **Build the Project**

   Use Maven to build the project:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

   This command compiles the project and resolves dependencies.

5. **Run the Application**

   Execute the main class to start the application:

   ```bash
   java -cp target/LinkUp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar app.Main
   ```

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Issue:** `mvn: command not found`
  - **Solution:** Ensure Maven is installed and added to your system's PATH.

- **Issue:** `java: command not found`
  - **Solution:** Ensure JDK is installed and added to your system's PATH.

- **Issue:** Authentication errors with MongoDB
  - **Solution:** Verify your MongoDB credentials in `config.properties`.
